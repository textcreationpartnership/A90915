            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ithin the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> somewhat neere Grub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street, there dwelleth a gentleman named <hi>Carey,</hi> a recusant, &amp; at his house there a great assembly of Papists doe continually use to meete, where they consult what may bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished to the setling of the triple Crowne the faster; Now this Gentleman had an Irish man to his servant, who was the man that revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all, and thus it hapned.</p>
            <p>There was a great consultation held the third of <hi>March</hi> last concerning many things, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be agreed upon a great while, at last stepped forth that Jesuiticall Priest <hi>Walker</hi> (who hath paid for his knaverie,) and spake after this manner.</p>
            <p>Men and brethren, I hope that you entertain no bad opinion of mee, for I sweare if you doe,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156985:3"/> that it is undeserved, I was always as true to the Pope as to my selfe, and as false to those hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and puritanicall English men as ever was <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> to his Lord and Master; Therefore I hope I may speake unto you a few words which are these.</p>
            <p>What meane these jarrs among your selves? it was long since <hi>axiomatike,</hi> that if a Kingdome was divided against it selfe it cannot stand, neither can a divided house, and as much it tends to a divided Sect, If you will therefore that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion should flourish, I desire to be enformed of your wils, and I shall set you in such a course that all the Devills in Hell shall never hinder you, they all with one accord manifested their ardent loves to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all desired him to proceed; Then this Priest began as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>If you remember your selves there was an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which came forth, that no recusant (as they tearme us) should have any armour in his house, now some of the wisest of our Sect, which are true Catholikes, foreseeing that such a thing would be, conveyed armour enough to accoutre twenty thousand men, horse and foot, into a wood in <hi>Shropshiere,</hi> called by the name of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham</hi> parke, where they have buried it, farr e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from all suspect whatsoever, now my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire is that wee should raise all our forces, and high thither for armour, and either winne the horse or loose the Saddle. Neither will we fight without policie, for you rising there in such a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156985:3"/> great multitude they can no way withstand you but with the trained bands all here &amp; thereabout, which when they bee gone against you wee have roome enough to play reakes here; Let mee alone to act cruelty enough, I'le burn and blow up all Churches and Hospitals, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were impiet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, but that they are used the wrong way. I protest before you all here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, that my soule doth hunger and thirst to do the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> good: For I hold it to bee the true primitive apostolicall Church. Now hee began to pause, with many admonitions to bee constant in this plot, and he had no feare at all but that it would come to good perfection. They all with Alacritie swore that they would either bring it to passe, or else they would pawne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, lives and goods in the pursuite thereof.</p>
            <p>Here may you see how readie they are to put mischiefe in action, how voluntarily they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict their bodies, and bee the chiefe agents to damne their souls; They must not thinke that the God of Heaven and earth, at whose beck the firmament doth bow, will either slumber or sleep to suffer such things as these to come to passe, he will not quite give off his <hi>Israel</hi> although shee hath sinned against Heaven and against him, not worthie any more to be taken notice of, hee sees this plot, mislikes it, and at the last prevents it, making themselves the revealers of their owne shame and confusion; and thus from them it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
            <p>The day being set, when this businesse should be put in practice, they went to incite some
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156985:4"/> friends which were far distant from them, that they would aid them in this holie practice (as they sayd;) well, letters are writ unto them, but now they want a trusty messenger to convey them.</p>
            <p>Now you must understand that in the same house there dwelt an Irish man, which was of their religion, him they employed, with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perswasions that he would bee secret, hee promised them he would, and had not God blinded his eyes on purpose to make him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealer of all; for this letter which he carried was directed to one Master <hi>Brayford,</hi> and he delivered it to one Master <hi>Brayard,</hi> which as soone as hee had read the contents of the letter, and finding out the plot, he caused the messenger to be clapt by the heeles, and sent abroad to raise the traine band, for he was Captain of a hundred; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, he marched towards this wood where they thought to arm themselves secretly, he was not come thither so soone but they were there before him, wherefore he cast his plot after this manner. Hee had gotten a matter of two thousand in his companie, them hee sent with a letter as if it had come from Master <hi>Brayford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The contents of the Letter was this.</p>
            <p>Friends I am glad that it hath pleased God to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite you so together, that you dare do this which you now are attempting, I will pray to the Saints for your good successe, but I cannot be with you my selfe by reason of a qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rterne ague which holds me here, but I have sent you two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156985:4"/> stout men, which I perswade my selfe wil be meritorious. After he had wrote this letter he disguised himselfe, and was also the messenger to carry it.</p>
            <p>When he came before them, and delivered his message, and they had read it, they were all recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with joy and gladnesse, their armour was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto them with incitations to be valiant. There they stayed all day in the Wood, at night they began to march, and so by little and little they were stealing towards <hi>London,</hi> because they thought to meet with their friends there, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were quite entred into <hi>Oxfordshiere</hi> this Master <hi>Brayard</hi> counselled them to divide their companies, so they might goe the better unsus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: they liked of his motion well; But they had no sooner come neer <hi>Alisbury</hi> in <hi>Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> but he betrayed them, and their secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and caused them to be apprehended, and some of them at this time lye in <hi>Alisbury</hi> Goal, untill they come to tryall.</p>
